    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for both **classification** and **regression** problems. It is a **non-parametric** and **lazy learning** algorithm, meaning it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution and does not build an explicit model during training. Instead, it stores the entire training dataset and performs computation only when a prediction is required.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The **Curse of Dimensionality** refers to a set of problems that arise when working with **high-dimensional data** (data with a large number of features). As the number of dimensions increases, the amount of data required to meaningfully analyze and model the data grows exponentially. This phenomenon was first introduced by **Richard Bellman**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of the Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "In high-dimensional spaces:\n",
    "- The **volume of the space increases exponentially**\n",
    "- Data points become **far apart from each other**\n",
    "- The concept of **“nearest” neighbor loses its meaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it difficult for algorithms like KNN to find truly similar neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why KNN Suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Distance Concentration Problem\n",
    "As dimensions increase:\n",
    "- The distance between the **nearest and farthest data points becomes almost the same**\n",
    "- Distance metrics (like Euclidean distance) lose their discriminating power\n",

    "### 2. Sparsity of Data\n",
    "- In higher dimensions, data becomes extremely sparse.\n",
    "- To maintain the same data density, an **exponentially larger dataset** is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ KNN needs much more data to perform well.\n",

    "➡️ Nearest neighbors may not be truly similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example to Understand the Effect on KNN\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **2D space**, neighbors are easy to identify.\n",
    "- In **100D space**, all points appear almost equally distant.\n",
    "\n",
